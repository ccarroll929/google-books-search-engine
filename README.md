## Description
In this project, I was tasked with taking a Google Books API search engine built with a RESTful API and refactoring it to be a GraphQL API built with Apollo Server. The app was built using the MERN stack, with a React front end, MongoDB database, and Node.js/Express.js server and API. This application allows users to signup/login, search for books in the Google Books API library, and save or delete books on their saved book list. 

### Deployed Application on Render:
